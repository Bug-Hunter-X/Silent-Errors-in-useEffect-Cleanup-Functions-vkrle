This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error is often silently swallowed, making debugging difficult.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someDataStream.subscribe(data => {
    // ... process data ...
  });

  return () => {
    // Cleanup function that might throw
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw an error if subscription is already unsubscribed
  };
}, []);
```
